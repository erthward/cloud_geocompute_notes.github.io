[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us)

These are the 3 biggest players in the arena general-purpose cloud computing services.

I have relatively little experience using these providers configuring, provisioning, and using cloud infrastructure for analysis. For basic thing (i.e., single virtual server instances that can be SSH'd into), there are straightforward tutorials available online.
However, for more complex tasks (e.g., setting up a Kubernetes cluster to use as a JupterHub instance akin the Microsoft Planetary Computer), I've thus far not taken the dive.
If I do at some point then I'll be sure to gather my notes here!
