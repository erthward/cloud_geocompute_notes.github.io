There are a (growing) number of other proprietary cloud platform providers for scientific/geospatial analysis. I have not used any of them all that much, but here's a quick list of options that might be worth looking into:
- [Posit Cloud (formerly, RStudio Cloud)](https://posit.cloud/)
- [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/)
- [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html)
- [Astraea](https://www.astraea.earth/)

I don't have much more to offer here at the moment!
