### Acknowledgments:
- Huge thanks to [Aaron Culich](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/aaron-culich) for many, early, and ongoing conversations that directed me to a lot of the resources presented here and that answered a lot of outstanding questions quickly and succinctly, leapfrogging what would have been slow and painful stages of the learning process.
- Huge thanks to [Tom Augspurger](http://tomaugspurger.net/about/), for not only basically building the freaking MSPC, but also for being regularly available and responsive when I posted what were likely often annoying questions on the MSPC Discussions board.
